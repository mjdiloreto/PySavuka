 REFERENCE FOR SAVUKA COMMANDS:





 ____________________________________________________________________________



 COMMAND: ABF



 SYNTAX: ABF bufferA bufferB



 USE: Adds the contents of bufferA to bufferB and places

      the result in bufferB.



 SEE ALSO: CBF, MBF, NEXt, XBF





 ____________________________________________________________________________



 COMMAND: ABS



 SYNTAX: ABS



 USE: Take the absolute value of the data.



 SEE ALSO:





 ____________________________________________________________________________



 COMMAND: Autocorrelation function



 SYNTAX: ACO  [ -r ]  frst_buff last_buff



 USE: Calculate the autocorrelation of the specified

      buffers.  The results are placed in the next

      available buffers.

      This command operates on all of the points in the

      buffers.

      The weights are included in the autocorrelation.



      Switches:

      -r   Operate on the residuals instead of the data.

           (useful for looking at randomness of resids).



 SEE ALSO: FFT, IFFT





 ____________________________________________________________________________



 COMMAND: ADD



 SYNTAX: ADD first_buffer last_buffer constant

 COMMAND: AFI



 SYNTAX: AFI



 USE: Automated fitting routine.  Useful for fitting large

      numbers of similar files to the same function.



 SEE ALSO: AUT





 ____________________________________________________________________________



 COMMAND: ALA



 SYNTAX: ALA scf



 USE: Scale factor used by the Levenburg-Marquardt algorythm

      to adjust the weighting of steepest decents in the

      quadratic model for chi-squared.  If the current model

      fails to improve the value of chi-squarred, the weight

      is adjusted up by a factor of scf.  Alternatively, the

      weight is decreased by a factor of scf whenever chi-

      squared is reduced.  Because the weight is added to the

      the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix, the

      quadratic model goes over to steepest decents when the

      weight is large.  Thus, the magnitude of scf controls

      how rapidly the algorythm switches the quadratic model

      and steepest decents.

      function to the data.  #iterations specifies an upper

      limit on the number of cycles for which chi-squared

      is minimized. Use PL first_buf last_buf first_pnt

      and last_pnt to specify range of data to fit.

      This routine uses the Marquardt algorithm

        The following options are available:

      -svd  Use the SVD algorithm to invert the curvature

            matrix.  Handles singular matrices.

      -d    Dump the curvature, derivative and covariance

            matrices to files alpha.vxy, dyda.vxy and

            covar.vxy. These files are in vxy format which

            can be read with the MR command.  Parameters

            are saved to dump.par.  The parameter mappings

            are saved in maplist.dat

      -a    Use analytical derivatives (which must be

            present in the compiled source code) instead

            of numerical derivatives (default).

      -cor  Output the parameter correlation matrix.

            This will add a column (map) to the parameter

            output that corresponds to the mapping of that

            parameter to a unique fitting parameter. The

            correlation matrix is given in terms of these

            unique parameters.  Only the bottom half of the

            matrix is shown for easier readibility (the

            matrix is symmetric).

       -v   Work in verbose mode.  This will output info

            during the fit that sane people prefer to ignore.

     -nodup This switch suppresses the output of non-unique

            parameters in the stat file/output.

 COMMAND: LNK



 SYNTAX: LNK [ -s ] param1 f_buf1 l_buf1 param2 f_buf2

         LNK param1 param2

         LNK param1

         LNK [ all ]



 USE: Links parameters during least-squares fitting.

      The convention is as follows: parameters are

      specified by a number (the order in which they

      appear in each buffer) and a buffer number. Above

      param1 and param2 refer to the former and f_buf1,

      f_buf2 and l_buf1 refer to the latter.  Thus, the

      LNK command links the parameter param1 in buffers

      f_buf1 through l_buf1 to the single parameter

      param2 in f_buf2. If the -s option is used then

      instead of linking to the single parameter param2

      in f_buf2 the linking will be done to param2 in

      successive buffers.

      The number of command line parameters specified is

      significant.  Specifying two parameter implies that

      the two numbers specified are those corresponding to

      param1 and param2, which are to be linked *within*

      each buffer for all buffers spanned by the current

      plot limits.

      Specifying just one number on the command line

      implies that param1 is to be linked for all buffers

      spanned by the current plot limits.

      Note that the order in which links are made is also

      important.  The second order links are not

      recognized and also (currently) not checked!

 SYNTAX: REA [-cn -xr ] filename



 USE: ReadS an ASCII data file into the first empty data

      buffer.  Four data formats are recognized:  X Y pairs,

      X Y E, Y only, and Y E.  For Y and Y E formats,

      first line should be the first x value and the

      second line should be the x increment.  Each line

      of the ASCII file should contain a minimum of 1 and a

      maximum of three entries seperated by 1 or more spaces.

      The data format of a file is determined automatically

      and each entry is parsed to ensure that it contains

      only numeric data.

        The -c[n] option allows one to read data that is

      in spreadsheet format with n specifying the column

      number that is to be read.  For example to read

      the third column as the y-data enter

      rea -c3 myfiles.asc.  The x-data is always assumed

      to be in the first column (i.e. -c2 is the default

      when reading x,y pairs).

        The -xr option reads the x,y pairs and interprets

      the y-values as row-values starting with the first

      buffer defined by the plot limits.

      be read into buffers first_U through last_U for

      the U matrix and starting with first_V for the

      V matrix (the same number of components must be

      read for U and V).  The reconstructed data set

      having dimension nrows_U x nrows_V is placed

      in the set of buffers starting with the buffer

      following the last buffer of V.  If the buffers

      of V have been fit, then the appropriate matrix

      multiplication is applied to the fit parameters

      also.  The result may then be used for backing

      out spectra using different kinetic models (SPE).

   -i option is used, a cubic spline

      interpolation is used to obtain parameter values

      corresponding to the row-values of the current data.

      This is useful e.g. for wav vs time data acquired at

      slightly different wavelengths.

   -x option allows one to read the parameters without

      interpolation and without reading in of the row-

      values of contained in the parameter file.  The
